# siosiana
Landing page for Siosiana 'Uheina Kalaniuvalu
Built this page in order to have a space to showcase Siosiana and her knowledge of Tongan Culture and Koloa
Built this project to futher my knowledge of all aspects of building a webpage - 
but more specifically in building functions in JavaScript as well as broadening my knowledge using CSS. 
There is a large gap in Tongan traditional culture, due to the majority of Tongan's living in the diaspora. 
Siosiana travles a lot to showcase Tongan culture, a website created specifically for her means that people to can read ahead about her upcoming workshops, 
see some of the Koloa she shares and one stop shop to contact. 
The project is the first I have seen to celebrate a pioneer of Tongan culture, Siosiana along with her sisters are in their 70s and 80s, the need to keep their work
and store their work on a site they can control to pass on to the next generation of Tongan knowledge seekers/holders.
